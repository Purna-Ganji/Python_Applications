A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent, built with Python and Tkinter.
Click any empty cell to place your O.

The AI (X) responds automatically.

Win by getting 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Click "New Game" to reset.

Try downloading the file(tic_tac_toe_gui.py) and running in your local system.
Another file tic-tac-toe.py can be played over terminal, a bit inconvenient compared to tic_tac_toe_gui.py.
